        <hr />

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>TEST.svelte</strong> is a temporary file created as part of the project’s early development process. The file serves as a placeholder and exists primarily to occupy space or assist with layout and functionality testing within the application. While the content in TEST.svelte may be limited, it plays an essential role in helping establish structure for other, more meaningful components.
        </p>

        <h2>Purpose and Use</h2>
        <p>The TEST.svelte component is used to simulate a functional Svelte component within the project. It enables developers to test layout spacing, component structure, and basic interactivity without needing finalized content. The component's presence ensures that the development process can move forward smoothly, even if real content or features are not yet ready.</p>

        <h2>Technologies Involved</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Svelte:</strong> TEST.svelte utilizes Svelte’s reactive framework, providing a simple way to test the project’s frontend behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>CSS or Tailwind (Optional):</strong> Depending on the project, minimal styling may be applied to TEST.svelte to test visual alignment and component responsiveness.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <p>While TEST.svelte is a simple placeholder, it includes several practical features for development purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Placeholder Layout:</strong> Basic layout elements serve as placeholders for future components.</li>
            <li><strong>Interactivity Testing:</strong> Minimal interactivity is sometimes added, such as buttons or links, to check event handling.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Layout Check:</strong> Ensures that basic layout and responsiveness work as expected across different devices and screen sizes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Development Impact</h2>
        <p>TEST.svelte, though simple, supports a faster development workflow by allowing layout and functionality testing before final components are ready. This approach ensures that the project’s structure is flexible, responsive, and ready to integrate fully developed content when available.</p>

        <h2>Future Plans</h2>
        <p>As the project progresses, TEST.svelte will likely be removed or replaced by actual functional components. Until then, it remains a critical testing asset, aiding in layout adjustments, feature previews, and basic development checks.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>TEST.svelte may be a simple and temporary component, but it serves an important purpose within the project. By providing a flexible placeholder for development testing, it contributes to a more streamlined development process and paves the way for robust, well-structured components in the final application.</p>
